    "The simulated probabilities closely match the exact analytical results, confirming that the Monte Carlo approach accurately estimates the probability of a perfect guess.  \n",
    "For the original 8-cup design, the probability of correctly identifying all cups by chance is approximately 0.0143 (1 in 70).  \n",
    "For the extended 12-cup design, this drops to about 0.0020 (1 in 495), showing that the likelihood of a perfect random guess decreases  as the number of cups increases.  \n",
    "Because the extended experiment makes a perfect guess so unlikely, one might reasonably consider relaxing the p-value threshold compared to the original setup, as even partial success would already be highly unlikely just by chance. "
